    "In my Prosper loan data exploratiion, I found out that there was a strong negative correlation between the prosper score and the borrower APR in the sense that as one increases, it led to the decrease of the other.\n",

    "I also discovered that the lender yield has a strong positive correlationm with the borrower APR, that is the lender gains more as the borrower APR increases.\n",

    "Outside my main features(prosper score and borrower APR), i also investigated the relationship between the length of the loan(term), the prosper score, borrower APR, the employment status and the loan status and came up with the following findings;\n",
    "1. The higher the loan length, the higher the prosper ratings.\n",
    "2. Loans that have past the due date attracts higher borrower ratings especially for the unemployed and i suggested that borrower should endeavour to pay up before the due dates."
